# Brain-Tumor-MRI-Classification
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify brain MRI images into four categories: **Glioma Tumor**, **Meningioma Tumor**, **Pituitary Tumor**, and **No Tumor**. The model was built using Keras and trained on a curated subset of 5,000 images from a larger dataset of 15,000+ MRI scans.
